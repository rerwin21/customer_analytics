# customer_analytics
Repository for Customer Analytics projects

## Structure and Purpose of Repository
The course is primarily applied machine learning and implemented in R. Moroever, the projects are group-oriented so it makes sense to use github for ease of sharing and version control.

We tackle different problems which can be addressed via machine learning: customer acquisition, upselling and cross-selling, and customer churn. Each problem has its own folder in the repository containing all code.
